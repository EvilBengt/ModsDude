# ModsDude

## In development

This application is under development and may not be, nor ever be, 100% stable.

## What is this?

A simple WPF-application for managing larger amounts of mods for the Farming Simulator games and keeping them up-to-date between players in multiplayer games.
This needs [EvilBengt/ModsDudeServer](https://github.com/EvilBengt/ModsDudeServer) to function!
